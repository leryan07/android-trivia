# Android Trivia 

The Android Trivia application is an application that asks the user trivia questions about Android development.
This is a toy app that was used for [Android App Development in Kotlin course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012).
The original repo can be found here (https://github.com/udacity/andfun-kotlin-android-trivia)
